# Trainfection

A game about driving a train while managing a virus outbreak in the carriages. 
Drive to the destination as fast as possible, send meds, drop carriages and try to save as many passengers as you can.
Made with unity and C# for a game jam.

The game can be played here: [Trainfection](https://marcelurpi.itch.io/trainfection)
